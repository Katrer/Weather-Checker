This is a small project designed to get accurate information regarding the weather around the globe.

There is more information that we can access from the API but for the sake of this project, I got only the most important ones imo.

You can get your own API key from OpenWeatherMap, if you want to do a similar project or you would like to test my project on your machine, just use a .env file with your own custom API Key.

Never keep your API Keys unprotected in a public repo.

Hope you enjoy the project!
